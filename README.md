Simple web page to help teaching our daughter to read. Images taken from googlebing. Sample text taken from a book from the library. No copyright infringement intended.


## To Do
- Switch imags to Bing
- Set up a Node server to server images so that we can hide Bing API key
- Allow image search to be different from word. For example, `Anna~[anna frozen]` will display the word Anna but search for the image 'anna frozen'
